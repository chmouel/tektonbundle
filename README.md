A CLI to go over a bunch of Tekton yaml resources and bundle them as one in a `Pipelinerun` and `pipelineSpec`/`taskSpec`.
It optionally can get argument to replace in tempalates.

## Install

```shell
pip3 install tektonbundle
```

and you are good to go!

`pyyaml` is really the external depencences here.

## Usage

You only need to point the tool to some yaml files or a directory where it will
collect every `.yaml` or `.yml` files in there and analyze them. It will then
output the 'bundled' yaml file which you can pipe to `kubectl create`, i.e:

```shell
tektonbundle "/path/to/directory"|kubectl create -f-
```

Full help of the CLI is :

```
usage: tektonbundle [-h] [--skip-inlining SKIP_INLINING] [--print-skipped]
                    files [files ...] [parameters [parameters ...]]

positional arguments:
  files                 Files and/or directories where to get all the yaml files.
  parameters            Add parameters to pass to templates.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --skip-inlining SKIP_INLINING
                        Skip inlining these tasks, you can add many of them separated by a comma.
  --print-skipped       Print non tekton files too.
```

## Description

If you have a Pipelinerun that looks like this :

```yaml
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipelinerun
metadata:
    name: pipeline-run
spec:
    pipelineRef:
        name: pipeline
```

and a `Pipeline` named pipeline1 that looks like this :

```yaml
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
    name: pipeline
spec:
    tasks:
    - name: task
      taskRef:
        name: task
```

and finally a task that looks like this :

```yaml
---
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: Task
metadata:
  name: task
spec:
  steps:
    - name: step
      image: scratch
```

It will 'bundle' everything as one, using `pipelineSpec` and `taskSpec`:

```yaml
apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
kind: PipelineRun
metadata:
  generateName: pipeline-run-
spec:
  pipelineSpec:
    tasks:
    - name: task
      taskSpec:
        steps:
        - image: scratch
          name: step
```

It will change the `name` as `generateName` to be unique.

You can skip some tasks to be inlined and be kept as referenced, you only have
to specify the switch `--skip-inlining` with the name of the task to be
skipped. You can add multiple of them separated by comma, i.e:
`--skip-inlining=task1,task2`

## Substition support via parameters.

`tektonbundle` support simple template substitions if you need to specify some value before applying.

If you have the string `key: {{value}}` in your template (no spaces in between).

And you launch the CLI with this arguments :

```shell
tektonbundle /path/to/dir value="hello"
```

The value of the template would be substited with the value you have provided.

If no value has been provided, it will be kept as is (you will end up with a `key: {{value}}` in your template).
